# Relaverse
RelaVerse is an application that to increase community participation in keeping the environment clean. An easy and effective solution for all. Together, we can create positive change and a better environment. Using machine learning, RelaVerse will automatically detect campaign titles. The application will immediately reject titles unrelated to environmental activities, and titles related to environmental activities can create campaigns for later publication.

# Machine Learning Used
We use natural language processing to detect title campaign on the application. First, we split the train and testing model into 80-20 proportion. 80% for the training model and 20% for the testing model. After that, we used the **stopwords** to eliminate unimportant words that not related to the environment activities. Then, we used **stemming** to extract the base form of the title campaign words that contain environmet activities by removing affixes from them. Next, we used **tokenizer** to converting title to undestanable bits of data by splitting the input data into a sequence of meaningful parts. Last, we save the model using **tensorflow.js**
